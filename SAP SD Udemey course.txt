Sales Order Cycle :

	In B2B (Business to Business), for buying goods from another business, the below steps will happen
		a) RIF --------> 	Request of Information . 
					It is an informal way of asking the
					seller to give an price details of the requestd products.
					It is called as INQURIY

		b) QUOTATION -->  After Inquiry , Quotation is  sent. Its the formal way of asking for
					products from a business. Quotation can be created in 2 ways
						i) with reference --> after inquiry is completed, we just use the 
									    inquiry number for creating a quotation.
									    this prevents the renentering the same data again
						ii) standalone -----> creating a quation from scratch
